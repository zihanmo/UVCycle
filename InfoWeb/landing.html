                                <p class="description">After finishing the paper prototype, we changed the name of this page from Exploration to Dictionary. Because the process just like using a dictionary. Users can search for words by typing English or Aboriginal words in the input box and see the corresponding information at the right-hand side of the notebook. Plus, the words can be sorted alphabetically by clicking on one of the letters from the alphabet on left-top of the notebook. To Part B, users can only learn one language (Yugarabul).</p>
                                <p class="part-reflection">In Part B, I had done almost all the functions in Dictionary Page and beyond what MVP requires. We got High Distinction in Part B, which is a great result for us, but we still have some details that need to be improved. The tutor gave suggestions on our document. We fixed the problem on time to avoid having the same problems in remaining work. And the Demo went successfully we got lots of constructive feedback as well.</p>

The selected language name is saved in local storage. Therefore, when the user clicks on a different marker in Map page, the corresponding content in the different dataset will be loaded by API. And words in the same language but in a different dataset are integrated into the corresponding language collection and displayed in Dictionary.</p>
                                <p class="part-reflection">So far, I have had done all of the functionalities in Dictionary page. For the process, I got lots of feedback from tutors and other students. Although I encountered some difficulties during programming, I solved them in time by asking tutors for help in workshops. During the time, I learnt new knowledge such as local storage and session storage. Implementing this project is really meaningful for me.</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of the semester, I said I want to learn how to make a complete website with good quality and do practice in using AJAX and PHP which are key elements of IT works. After done the Major Project, I have already known how to link the interface with online data via API, which is a significant function that needs to be familiar with. In addition, I have a deeper understanding of JavaScript including how to implement the function and how to use AJAX and JSON. And the situation that made me worry at first did not happen, every member was very active, and every step went smoothly. We solved many problems together, and it’s a good experience for us to work together. Overall, I met the goals of this semester and learned a lot of new knowledge.</p>

                            <h2>Learning Across the Course</h2>
                            <p>As a developer, I also learnt a lot how to design a website. In the Workshop and Contact hours, I communicated with tutors actively to get feedback as much as possible to make improvement on our project, which is the thing I didn’t do in DECO1400 and DECO1100. I seized the opportunities of every exercise as well to do reflection and fix problems. I really felt having discussion and exchange ideas with other is a good way for a designer. To design a good website, I should not only focus on code, but also need to consider user experience comprehensively. </p>

                            <h2>Changes</h2>
                            <p>Forming a team to do the project is really a good way, each member can play a role in the team and focus on a piece of work. I cannot imagine what else can be improved in this class because it is comprehensive and perfect. Finally, thanks to the teaching team for helping us in this semester!</p>
